## Overview
Everything in here should be prety standard.

I didn't use a notebook for my process because I found it easier to just use Python files for my workflow in this type of project. I tried a large variety of models but the KNN seemed to be the one producing the best results on the test set. I think I may still have a looming Scaling bug that caused that issue. Oh well.

## Runing the Code
```
python main.py
```
Run this in the associated Anaconda environment.
